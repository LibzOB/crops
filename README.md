The dataset used in this software is designed to be used to help farmers make the most efficient use of their land. 
The dataset contains a various sets of conditions and recommended crops for each condition.
Firstly, you will be led through the preparation of the dataset and visualisation of the data.
Finally, you will be able to enter the conditions of your land when prompted to be given a list of recommended crops for your land.
Instead of entering your exact land conditions, you will be prompted to write the category under which your land comes, for each condition. For example, Nitrogen Category 1 = nitrogen values < 30, therefore if your nitrogen concentration in your land is 20, you would write '1'.
